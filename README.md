## Projects

### Brain-Games   [:arrow_forward: to repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/Brain-Games.git)
This project includes five simple console-based mathematical problems implemented in JavaScript. It helped me solidify my basic programming and logical thinking skills.

### JSON-or-YML-files-comparison  [:arrow_forward: to repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/JSON-or-YML-files-comparison.git)
A console application for comparing two JSON or YML files. The program outputs the results in text, stylized, and JSON formats. Tools like Jest for testing and Commander.js for creating the command-line interface were used in this project. This project demonstrates my skills in file manipulation, testing, and continuous integration.

### RSS Aggregator  [:arrow_forward: to repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/RSS-Aggregator.git)
A browser application for aggregating RSS feeds, allowing users to conveniently read various sources such as blogs. The application allows users to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, automatically update them, and add new entries to a common feed. The project used libraries such as `on-change`, `i18next`, `yup`, and `axios`. A feature of the project is the use of promises for asynchronous programming without using `async/await`.
