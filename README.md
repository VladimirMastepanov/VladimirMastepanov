# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladimir, and I am a frontend developer. I am passionate about creating interactive and functional web applications. My portfolio includes several challenging projects where I applied best practices in UI/UX design, state management, and asynchronous programming.

## About Me

I have completed courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have also studied React, Redux, and Redux Toolkit. Despite not having commercial experience yet, I have independently completed several projects, which are available on my GitHub.

## Skills and Technologies

- Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks and Libraries: React, Redux, Redux Toolkit
- Methodologies: Asynchronous programming, testing, continuous integration

## Projects

### Chatify [:arrow_forward: repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/Chatify) [:arrow_forward: project demo](https://chatify-dxv7.onrender.com/) *use admin/admin for login/password*

Chatify is a real-time messaging application built with React and Redux, offering support for multiple channels. Users can sign up or log in to join chat rooms, create new channels, rename or delete them as needed.

### RSSFusion [:arrow_forward: repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/RSSFusion) [:arrow_forward: project demo](https://frontend-project-11-iota-neon.vercel.app/)

A browser application for aggregating RSS feeds, allowing users to conveniently read various sources such as blogs. The application allows users to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, automatically update them, and add new entries to a common feed. The project used libraries such as `on-change`, `i18next`, `yup`, and `axios`. A feature of the project is the use of promises for asynchronous programming without using `async/await`.

### JsonYamlDiff  [:arrow_forward: repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/JsonYamlDiff)
A console application for comparing two JSON or YML files. The program outputs the results in text, stylized, and JSON formats. Tools like Jest for testing and Commander.js for creating the command-line interface were used in this project. This project demonstrates my skills in file manipulation, testing, and continuous integration.

### BrainGames  [:arrow_forward: repository](https://github.com/VladimirMastepanov/BrainGames)
This project includes five simple console-based mathematical problems implemented in JavaScript. It helped me solidify my basic programming and logical thinking skills.
